## Overview

This repository contains the exercises and projects from the **42 Python for Data Science Piscine**. The curriculum is designed to provide a deep dive into Python programming with a specific focus on data manipulation, analysis, and object-oriented programming.

The journey starts from the basics and progresses to advanced libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 📚 Modules

### [Module 0 - Starting](0%20-%20Starting)
**Basics & Environment Setup**
-   Introduction to Python syntax and scripts.
-   Standard input/output operations.
-   Basic data types and control structures.

### [Module 1 - Array](1%20-%20Array)
**Numerical Computing with NumPy**
-   Understanding arrays and matrix operations.
-   Image manipulation (loading, slicing, modifying pixels).
-   Broadcasting and vectorization.

### [Module 2 - DataTable](2%20-%20DataTable)
**Data Analysis with Pandas**
-   Loading and processing CSV/JSON datasets.
-   Data cleaning and filtering.
-   Statistical analysis and aggregation.

### [Module 3 - OOP](3%20-%20OOP)
**Object-Oriented Programming**
-   Classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
-   Error handling and exceptions.
-   Special methods (dunder methods).

### [Module 4 - DoD](4%20-%20Dod)
**Data Oriented Design & Visualization**
-   Advanced plotting with Matplotlib/Seaborn.
-   Data visualization best practices.
-   Performance optimization.

## 🛠️ Requirements

-   Python 3.10+
-   Libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## 🚀 Usage

Each folder corresponds to a specific module and contains numbered exercises (e.g., `ex00`, `ex01`). To run a specific exercise:

```bash
cd "2 - DataTable/ex00"
python3 load_csv.py
```
